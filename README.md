# Generalized-ODIN-Implementation

This is a (reproduced) implementation of the method described in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11297.pdf). Note that this implementation is not currently capable of perfectly reproducing the results published in the paper, though the results are close; the reason for this is unknown. If you would like to contribute, please see the "contributions" section in this README.

## Running the demo

Defaults: cosine h(x), denseNet, cifar10, imagenet crop, 300 epochs, cross-entropy loss

Main two files are cal.py and deconfnet.py

To train, simply call
```python cal.py ```
